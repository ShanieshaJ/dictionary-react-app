# Picturetionary io

This is a web application and it is made using React. This application can search any word and will give you the meaning, phonetics, definition, and examples. This web app is deployed on Netlify.




## Lessons Learned

From what I learned from buliding this application is that I had to learn the new features in React 18 since the previous version features had become **out-updated**. 

The challenges I faced while buliding this application in SheCodes React was trying to get the [Dictionary](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/) apis to work with all the component pages that I had created but it was not working properly. In addition, the Dictionary api had stopped working for a few days, which caused the app not work properly.

What I did to overcome these challenges: 

Firstly, I looked over and read the Api documentations to understand and figure out what I was doing wrong. Turns out I was not using the correct syntax in getting the meaning of word after the user has typed in the word and clicking search to perform the action.

Futuremore, for the Dictionary Api, it was not working for a while and I discovered that SheCodes was aware of the situation and created their own [dictionary](https://www.shecodes.io/learn/apis/dictionary) and [images](https://www.shecodes.io/learn/apis/images) apis instead. However, their documentation made it more simplier and easier to understand the syntaxes better.
